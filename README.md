Based on the code, when the transaction code (trncode) is "5" and it's a Lapse operation, here are the key functionalities:

Initial Checks and Setup:


First checks if the policy already exists in the system by looking at the policy count
If policy exists, checks for any existing claims on the policy
Validates the broker code and gets the writing office (wo) number
For homeowner policies, uses a special broker office number from system configuration


Policy Handling:


If a previous policy exists (countpol > 0):

Calls the Lapse(edirecno) method to process the lapse


If no previous policy exists (countpol == 0):

Calls Lapse("NR", edirecno) to create a new lapsed policy




The Lapse() Method Key Functions:


Creates a new policy version with status "Not Renewed" (NR)
Sets all policy values:
javaCopyif (trncode.equals("NR")) {
    ht_pol.put("effdate", EDI_IICESUtil.dateDBToTimestamp(rs_policy.getString("edieffdate")));
    ht_pol.put("expdate", EDI_IICESUtil.dateDBToTimestamp(rs_policy.getString("ediexpdate")));
    ht_pol.put("termprem", new Integer(0)); // Sets premium to 0
    ht_pol.put("prem", new Integer(0));
    ht_pol.put("comm", new Double(0.00));
}



Additional Processing:


Updates policy history with "MANDATORY NOT RENEWED" status
Creates/updates necessary database records:

MSFOLDER (folder information)
TSMAILER (mailing information)
TSFNAME (name information)
MSPOLICY (policy information)
TSTRAN (transaction information)
MSPOLHIST (policy history)




Location Handling:


For non-standard policies:

Updates location information
Updates province splits
Updates coverage information
Creates necessary invoicing records




Final Steps:


Updates the EDIPOLICY table with new status
Logs the lapse transaction
Updates folder expiry dates
Marks folder as inactive

The key purpose is to:

Process the policy as "Not Renewed"
Set premiums to zero
Update all related records to reflect the lapsed status
Maintain historical records of the lapse
Handle any location or coverage changes
Generate appropriate logs and notifications

This represents a complete termination of the policy through non-renewal rather than cancellation.
